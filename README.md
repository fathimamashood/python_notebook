#Python Beginner's Notebook

This notebook provides code samples with explanation for those who are getting started with Python. Since Python3 has been around for a while (and hence stable and high package support), we decide to use Python3 for this notebook.

Our motto is to learn by doing. Therefore, it is important for you to try the code by yourself, modify it, improve it, find bugs and make a better version!
